# CallingMethods

The CallingMethods project is a console application that demonstrates the usage of methods in C#. It includes a separate class with three methods that perform various mathematical operations on an integer parameter. The Main() program asks the user for a number and calls each method, displaying the returned integer to the screen.

# Project Description
The CallingMethods project consists of two files: Program.cs and MathOperations.cs.

MathOperations.cs

This file contains a class called MathOperations with three methods:

Addition(int num)

Takes an integer parameter num.

Performs an addition operation on num.

Returns the result of the addition as an integer.

Subtraction(int num)

Takes an integer parameter num.

Performs a subtraction operation on num.

Returns the result of the subtraction as an integer.

Multiplication(int num)

Takes an integer parameter num.

Performs a multiplication operation on num.

Returns the result of the multiplication as an integer.

Program.cs

This file contains the Main() method, which serves as the entry point of the application. It interacts with the user, calls the methods from the MathOperations class, and displays the returned integers.

# Instructions

Start the console application.

The program will prompt you to enter a number you want to perform the math operations on.

Enter the desired number.

The program will call each method from the MathOperations class, passing the user input as the parameter.

The returned integer from each method will be displayed on the screen.

Observe the results of the addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations performed on the user-provided number.

The program will terminate, and you can rerun it to perform calculations with different numbers.

# Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following skills and concepts related to methods and console applications in C#:

Creating a separate class file

Defining and implementing methods with parameters and return types

Performing mathematical operations using methods

Calling methods from the Main() program

Interacting with the user through console input and output

Handling and displaying integer results
